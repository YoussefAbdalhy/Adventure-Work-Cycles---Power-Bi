# Adventure-Work-Cycles---Power-Bi
## Project Overview:
  This Project was a part of a Udemy Course under the title of Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence which I recommend to anyone who needs to      learn how to use Microsoft Power BI.

  Adventure Works Cycles is a large, multinational manufacturing company that produces and distributes metal and composite bicycles to commercial markets in North America, Europe, and Asia. 
  AWCâ€™s Business Intelligence Team was given the sales data from 2015 to 2017 and the Stakeholders were interested in creating a dashboard that preview the sales performance from 1/1/2016 to 30/6/2017 and also Information about products and customers.
